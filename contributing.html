    <h2>Contributing to Apache Kudu (incubating)</h2>
    <p>
      There are lots of ways to get involved with the Kudu project. Some of
      them are listed below. You don't have to be a developer; there are lots of
      valuable and important ways to get involved that suit any skill set and level.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to do something not listed here, or you see a gap that needs to be filled,
      <a href="mailto:dev@kudu.incubator.apache.org">let us know</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Participate in the community.</h3>
    <p>
      Community is the core of any open source project, and Kudu is no exception. Participate in the
      mailing lists, requests for comment, chat sessions, and bug reports.
      See <a href="community.html">Community</a> to get started.
    </p>

    <h3>Talk about how you use Kudu.</h3>
    <p>
      Let us know what you think of Kudu and how you are using it. Send blogs or presentation links
      to the <a href="mailto:user@kudu.incubator.apache.org">kudu-user mailing list</a>
      so that we can feature them.
    </p>

    <h3>File bugs and enhancement requests.</h3>
    <p>
      If you see problems in Kudu or if a missing feature would make Kudu more useful to you,
      let us know by filing a bug or request for enhancement on the
      <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU">Kudu JIRA issue tracker</a>. The more
      information you can provide about how to reproduce an issue or
      how you'd like a new feature to work, the better.
    </p>

    <h3>Write code and submit patches.</h3>
    <p>
      You can submit patches to the core Kudu project or extend your existing codebase and APIs
      to work with Kudu. The Kudu project uses
      <a href="http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/q/status:open+project:kudu">Gerrit</a>
      for code reviews.

      Please read the details of
      <a href="docs/contributing.html#_contributing_patches_using_gerrit">how to use submit patches</a>
      and what the project <a href="docs/contributing.html#_code_style">coding guidelines</a>
      are before your submit your patch, so that your contribution will be easy for others to
      review and integrate.
    </p>

    <h3>Review patches and test new code.</h3>
    <p>
      In order for patches to be integrated into Kudu as quickly as possible, they must be reviewed
      and tested. The more eyes, the better. Even if you are not a committer your review input is extremely
      valuable. Keep an eye on the
      <a href="http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/q/status:open+project:kudu">Kudu gerrit instance</a>
      for patches that need review or testing.
    </p>

    <h3>Write and review documentation.</h3>
    <p>
      Making good documentation is critical to making great, usable software. If you see gaps in
      the documentation, please submit suggestions or corrections to the mailing list
      or submit documentation patches through Gerrit.
      You can also correct or improve error messages, log messages, or API docs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd like to translate the Kudu documentation into a different
      language or you'd like to help in some other way, please <a href="community.html">let us know</a>.
      It's best to review the <a href="docs/style_guide.html">documentation guidelines</a> before you get started.
    </p>

    <h3>Request and review examples.</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/kudu-examples">kudu-examples</a> repository includes
      working code examples. As more examples are requested and added, they will need review and clean-up.
      This is another way you can get involved.
